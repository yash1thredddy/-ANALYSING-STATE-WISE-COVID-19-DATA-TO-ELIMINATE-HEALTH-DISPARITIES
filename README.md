# -ANALYSING-STATE-WISE-COVID-19-DATA-TO-ELIMINATE-HEALTH-DISPARITIES

COVID-19, a pandemic, has thrown the world into chaos like it's never seen before. COVID-19 has had a significant impact on people's lives all around the world, requiring the closure or suspension of nearly all socio-economic activities. However, due to limited healthcare infrastructure, lengthy distances to advanced health care, and population characteristics, rural locations (despite their low population density) may be especially prone to poor COVID-19 outcomes (e.g., high tobacco use, hypertension, obesity, older age). In this project, we gathered and organised many publications on covid-19, then utilised machine learning techniques to do a comparative analysis using ML to identify state-by-state death rates, and finally, we provided the best ML algorithm for classifying the dataset. During the COVID-19 pandemic and future outbreaks, we hope that our experience can be replicated in areas with comparable rural environments.
